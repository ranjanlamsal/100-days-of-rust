### Day 33

##### NPM packages and how the internet works

**Today's Progress**

#### How the web Works

The user/client types in the url of a webpage in a browser, the request is sent to the server where the website is hosted then the server sends back the response by getting the webpage content to the client. This is called client-server architecture or Resquest reponse model.

1. First when your enter the domain name it is sent back to DNS Domain Name Server where it gets the real IP address of the website.
   //https://www.google.com/maps to https://216.58.211.206:443. The protocol is http|| https, IP address is 216.58.211.206 and port number is 443 for https || 80 for http.

2. A TCP/IP socket connection is established between the server and the client. TCP is the Transmission Control Protocol and IP is the Internet Protocol, they ddefine how data travels across the web. They set the rules on how data moves across the internet.

3. The Http request is sent to the server. HTTP is Hyper Text Transmission Protocol which is a communication protocol that allows two or more systems to communicate. Http is a protocol that allows the client and server to communicate by sending and receiving messages.
   Types of HTTP methods: (GET/maps HTTP/1.1)

- GET - for requesting data
- post - for sending data
- patch - for modifying data
  The HTTP request has the :
- Start line contains: Http method, request target and http version.
- Http request header has contains Host : www.google.com, User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 and Accepted language - en-us
- Body response only when it's sending data to the server. (POST)

4. A HTTP response is sen back from the server.
   The http response contains:(HTTP/1.1 200 ok)

- Start line with http version, status code and status message.
- Response message
- response body

5. The TCP breaks the HTTP request and response into small chunks called packets before they are sent, then it assemble them into their original request and response. The IP protocol sends and routes all the packets through the internet. It makes sure the packets goes back to their respetive IP addresses.

(Amazing summary notes from Jonas course)

**Results:** I was able to understand how the internet works behind the scenes.

### Day 34

##### NPM packages and how the internet works

**Today's Progress**

#### Static, Dynamic and Api-powered websites

- Static websites have ready files that are served to the browser. Like Html, Css, Jvascript and images files. They display the same content for every user.

- Dynamic website are built on the server each time a new request comes in. It has a database which get the data, with a pre-defined template it builds each page the user requests. From each client based request the page is build with Html, css, images and javascript. This pages are then sent to the browser. This process is also callled server-side rendering. Thus it dynamic beccause the content can change according to the user actions or data in the database. Example is the Twitter website, every time you login you see different tweets.

Web application are dynamic websites with functionality like logging in, signing up or creating profiles.

- API-powered website are websites that have a database that fetches data and its build in two steps:
  a) Building the Api
  b) Consuming the Api
  The Api-powered websites are dynamic websites but the only difference is that Api-powered website send JSON data format to the browser not the entire website. Only the data is sent to the client, no Html,css or js files. When it reaches the browser, it builds the website through the templates created.
  An API is Aplication Programming Interface which is a software that allows application to talk to each other.

(Amazing summary notes from Jonas course)

**Results:** I was able to understand how the internet works behind the scenes.

### Day 44

##### Desigining in Figma

**Today's Progress**

#### Designing beats studio3.

- I have always been using Photoshop or Adobe XD for design but when I started learning how to code during the lockdown, I shifted to Figma. Most because of the code snipped thay have. It makes it easier to code faster when you can see the height and width of your component in each frame. I used the bests by Dre offical website to get an inspiration to create another version of it but for only the skyline collection. I have always loved the quality of these headphones used them once when watching a movie and I immediately fell in love with them. Hope I will have enough money to buy one or two someday.

**Results:** ‚úç Created the skyline collection website for beats by Dre and made different frames from desktop to mobile. It always good to make website responsive.

### Day 45-46

##### Coding in Figma

**Today's Progress**

#### Building beats studio3.

- The past three days have been helpful. I was able to starting a real small website project that I designed in Figma. I wanted to go through the whole process of sketching, responsive design in figma to coding the website. I used Tailwind CSS a Css framework to learn and practice. The only way to I understand is by doing and seeing everything detail completed to the end. I used some custom css style like the colors, insets, rems, font family and font sizes to ensure the coded website looked like the design (Talkimg about making things pixel perfect. hahaha). I never used min-width in my coding, so it took a minute before I got used to it. But I can say I love Tailind Css and I will be using it more in my projects.

**Results:** ‚úç Coded a responsive website with Tailwind Css called [Beats studio3](https://github.com/muchirijane/Beats-studio3) by Beats by Dre.

### Day 50-51

##### Learned about useState in React

**Today's Progress**

#### Going down the path to know about useState in react

- Got to learn more about useState by Max in Udemy. This lesson explains how you can both write with class component and also useState to get the same result when write state and changing it with setState method. I also got to learn about handling event handlers in React lick onClick and onChange. I got to love using react hooks at least using useState instead of class component. The use of arrow functions makes it easier.

**Results:** üë©‚Äçüíª Attended the Figma Euro Conference and revised on JSX syntax and react components.

and I can get back to coding. So don't mind seeing the lack of commits for 4-5 weeks. I will back soon(pray for me <3).

---

### Day 6 to Day 10

##### Made a todo app with Firebase

**Today's Progress**: I tried to make a web app that 1

**Task Accomplished:** The project was created with React Js, Material UI and Firebase. The user can create a task set the title and detail of it and choose the category of the task. It can be a reminder, personal, money or work related task. The user can delete the task after finishing it and this will also be deleted in the firebase cloud store. 
- The great thing I found about firebase is the documenation is easy to follow even if it's your first time using it. 
- This was also my first time using material UI for creating the components and I enjoyed. The docs have information that is straight forward and have clear examples.

### Day 12

##### Learnt about React testing (intro)

**Today's Progress**
# React Testing

## There are two types of testing
- Manual Testing: This is coding and previewing the code in the browser and test it to see if it works. 
- Automated Testing: writing code that will test the code you have written. You can test a section or your entire code.

### Why test 
- Helps to catch errors/bugs early 
- Write and ship better code

### Types of Automated Testing

#### 1) Unit Tests
Test the individual blocks of the components. This is the most common and important test to conduct in your apps.

#### 2) Intergration Tests
- Test multiple building blocks. Even though Intergration tests are important, there are used less but unit test are used more.

#### 3) End-to-End Tests
- This about testing the entire workflow of your app. It's just like manual testing but automated.
- They are fewer e2e tests.

**Results**

```js
import { render, screen } from "@testing-library/react"
import Greeting from "./Greeting"

describe('greeting component', () => {
  test('renders hello world as a text', () => {
    //Arrange
    render(<Greeting />);
    //Act
    //.... nothing to do here

    //Assert
    const helloElement = screen.getByText('Hello world', { exact: false });
    expect(helloElement).toBeInTheDocument();
  })
  test('renders hey as a text', () => {
    //Arrange
    render(<Greeting />);
    //Act
    //.... nothing to do here

    //Assert
    const welcomeElement = screen.getByText('Hey');
    expect(welcomeElement).toBeInTheDocument();
  })
})

```

**About the project**

#### Front-end Project.

- I started by Looking for a well designed website that's complete and have all the pages from the figma community. Since I want to practice more on how to use Material UI and customize the theme, i decided to go with it instead of Tailwind css.

 - Material UI | MUI
```

**Today's Progress**
- Continued with the project to code out the hero section, about section and the feature section. 
- I got stuck in creating the theme especially the typography but when I googled and used MUI documentation I got better at coding the section. 
- MUI made it easier to code up the section, but when the design component is complex, creating the theme to fit your project is better.

### Day 23 - 24
##### Form with React  Project

**Today's Progress**

#### Create form with a custom Hook.

- I went to learn how to build forms in react in different ways. 
  1) Using State: This was good because of repetitive code when you want to validate the inputs. 
  2) Using Custom Hooks: This is a better methos since the code is well structured and not repetitive when validating the form. 

- The form at first has the button disabled, the user can't send any info without filling in the inputs. 
- If any of the input is empty the form can't be sent and the button will remain disabled. On top of this, each input will show you the errors through a p text. 
- Only when all input are correct and are not empty the button is active and can submit the data.   

- The project was built with: 
```bash
 - CSS
 - Javascript
 - React JS
```
